## üöß Challenges faced

#### 1. Code Organization

Code organization can always be challanging yet a fun and constructive one. As a component grows in size in terms of its lines of code, to keep the code cleaner and organized, I isolated specific parts of the code to separate components.

I also created a custom hook for separating concerns, addressing the fetch logic in an isolated reusable function. 

#### 2. Syncing Search, Sort & Filter Functionality 

After sorting and filtering products, I noticed that performing a search would only search among the sorted and filtered products. In order to apply the search functionality on all the products, I made the searchbar reset the sort and filter features every time anything is typed on it, thereby allowing the app to search among all products.

#### 3. Addressing warnings

While integrating react router into the project, some warnings started showing up titled "React Router Future Flag". I looked it up on the React Router DOM documentation, which suggested to enable certain flags to avoid the error, and it worked.
